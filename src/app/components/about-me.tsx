            Hello from Yana, the videographer and UGC creator. Originally from
            Ukraine, now live in Texas.

            My journey into content creation began with a passion for crafting
            vibrant and emotional videos. Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of projects,
            ranging from family and sports shoots to content for beauty salons,
            home goods, product shoots, and lifestyle storytelling. Now, I aim
            to use my experience and creativity to help brands connect with
            their audience.
